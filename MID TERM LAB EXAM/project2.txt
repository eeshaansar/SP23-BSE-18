Semester 2: Weather Application
Description: This project focuses on developing a weather application that fetches real-time weather data using an external API.
 Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the app allows users to search for weather conditions by city and view forecasts. 
 The project aims to enhance skills in API integration, asynchronous programming, and responsive design.
